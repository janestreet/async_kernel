"Async_kernel"
==============

`Async_kernel` contains `Async`'s core data structures, like `Deferred`.
`Async_kernel` is portable, and so can be used in JavaScript using Async_js. In
principle it could also be used on Windows, but no scheduler has been written
for Async on Windows as of yet.

API documentation for the latest release can be found
[here](https://ocaml.janestreet.com/ocaml-core/latest/doc/async/index.html).
