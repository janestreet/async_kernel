include module type of Core.Gc with module Expert := Core.Gc.Expert

(** [add_finalizer b f] ensures that [f] runs after [b] becomes unreachable. [f b] will
    run in its own Async job. If [f] raises, the unhandled exception will be raised to the
    monitor that called [add_finalizer b f].

    The OCaml runtime only supports finalizers on heap blocks, hence [add_finalizer]
    requires [b : _ Heap_block.t].

    The runtime essentially maintains a set of finalizer pairs:

    {[
      'a Heap_block.t * ('a Heap_block.t -> unit)
    ]}

    Each call to [add_finalizer] adds a new pair to the set. It is allowed for many pairs
    to have the same heap block, the same function, or both. Each pair is a distinct
    element of the set.

    After a garbage collection determines that a heap block [b] is unreachable, it removes
    from the set of finalizers all finalizer pairs [(b, f)] whose block is [b], and then
    runs [f b] for all such pairs. Thus, a finalizer registered with [add_finalizer] will
    run at most once.

    In a finalizer pair [(b, f)], it is a mistake for the closure of [f] to reference
    (directly or indirectly) [b] -- [f] should only access [b] via its argument. Referring
    to [b] in any other way will cause [b] to be kept alive forever, since [f] itself is a
    root of garbage collection, and can itself only be collected after the pair [(b, f)]
    is removed from the set of finalizers.

    The [f] function can use all features of OCaml and Async, since it runs as an ordinary
    Async job. [f] can even make [b] reachable again. It can even call [add_finalizer] on
    [b] or other values to register other finalizer functions. *)

(** [add_finalizer_exn b f] is like {{!add_finalizer} [add_finalizer]}, but will raise if

val add_finalizer_exn : 'a -> ('a -> unit) -> unit

(** Same as {{!add_finalizer} [add_finalizer]} except that the function is not called
    until the value has become unreachable for the last time. This means that the
    finalization function does not receive the value as an argument. Every weak pointer
    and ephemeron that contained this value as key or data is unset before running the
    finalization function. *)
