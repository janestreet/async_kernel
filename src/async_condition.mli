(** Async's implementation of the standard notion of a "condition" variable.

    This is analogous to OCaml's [Condition] module. The main guarantee that a condition
    variable provides is that a call to [signal] (or [broadcast]) after a call to [wait]
    will be seen by the waiter.

    Unlike the use of condition variables in ordinary threaded programs, Async condition
    variables do not require a mutex, since Async programs are cooperatively threaded. *)
