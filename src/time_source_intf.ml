(** A time source holds a time (possibly wall-clock time, possibly simulated time) and
    gives the ability to schedule Async jobs to run when that time advances.

    There is a single wall-clock time source (returned by [wall_clock ()]) that the Async
    scheduler drives and uses for the [Clock_ns] module.  One can also create a
    user-controlled time source via [create], and advance its clock as desired.  This is
    useful so that state machines can depend on a notion of time that is distinct from
    wall-clock time. *)

      step, [advance_by_alarms] waits for the result of [wait_for] to become determined
      before advancing. By default, [wait_for] will be [Scheduler.yield ()] to allow the
      triggered timers to execute and potentially rearm for subsequent steps. The returned
      deferred is filled when [to_] is reached.

      [advance_by_alarms] is useful in simulation when one wants to efficiently advance to
      a time in the future while giving periodic timers (e.g., resulting from [every]) a
      chance to fire with approximately the same timing as they would live. *)
