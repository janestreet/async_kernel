(* [connect] takes ivars [bind_result] and [bind_rhs], and makes [bind_rhs]
   be an [Indir] pointing to the non-indir cell reachable from [bind_result].  On entry
   to [connect], [bind_result] and [bind_rhs] may be chains, since [bind_rhs] is an
   arbitrary user-supplied deferred, and [bind_result] is returned to the user prior to
   being [connect]ed, and may have been converted to an indirection in the case of
   right-nested binds.

   The purpose of [connect] is to make tail-recursive bind loops use constant space.
   E.g.:

   {[
     let rec loop i =
       if i = 0
       then return ()
       else (
         let%bind () = after (sec 1.) in

   [connect] makes intermediate bind results all be [Indir]s pointing at the outermost
   bind, rather than being a linear-length chain, with each pointing to the previous one.
   Then, since the program is only holding on to the innermost and outermost binds all the
   intermediate ones can be garbage collected.

   ultimate result. *)
