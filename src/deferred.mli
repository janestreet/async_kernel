(** A value that will become determined asynchronously.

    A deferred can be "undetermined" or "determined".  A deferred that is undetermined may
    at some point become determined with value v, and will henceforth always be determined
    with value v. *)

(** [sexp_of_t t f] returns a sexp of the deferred's value, if it is determined, or an
    informative string otherwise.

    This is just for display purposes.  There is no [t_of_sexp]. *)

(** Deferreds form a monad.

    [let%bind v = t in f v] returns a deferred [t'] that waits until [t] is determined
    with value [v], at which point it waits for [f v] to become determined with value
    [v'], to which [t'] will become determined.

    [return v] returns a deferred that is immediately determined with value v.

    Note that:

    {[ upon t f ]}

    is more efficient than:

    {[ ignore (let%bind a = t in f a; return ()) ]}

    because [upon], unlike [let%bind], does not create a deferred to hold the result.

    For example, one can write a loop that has good constant factors with:

    {[
      let rec loop () =
        upon t (fun a -> ... loop () ... ) ]}

    although often [forever] or [repeat_until_finished] is more clear.

    The same loop written with [let%bind] would allocate deferreds that would be
    immediately garbage collected.  (In the past, this loop would have also used linear
    space in recursion depth!)

    In general, for deferreds that are allocated by [let%bind] to be garbage collected
    quickly, it is sufficient that the allocating bind be executed in tail-call position
    of the right-hand side of an outer bind. *)

val any_unit : unit t list -> unit t

(** [don't_wait_for t] ignores [t].  It is like [Fn.ignore], but is more constrained
    because it requires a [unit Deferred.t].

    Rather than [ignore (t : _ t)], do [don't_wait_for (Deferred.ignore_m t)].

    We chose to give [don't_wait_for] type [unit t] rather than [_ t] to catch errors
    where a value is accidentally ignored. *)
val don't_wait_for : unit t -> unit

(** A [Choice.t] is used to produce an argument to [enabled] or [choose].  See below. *)
module Choice : sig
  type +'a t = 'a Deferred1.Choice.t

  val map : 'a t -> f:('a -> 'b) -> 'b t
end

(** [choice t g] corresponds to one alternative to use in [choose].

    One needs to be mindful of memory leaks and effect leaks when using this interface: if
    the corresponding choice is not taken, then [t] is simply discarded (as if
    [don't_wait_for] was called), but any work that was scheduled to make [t] determined
    won't be cancelled automatically.

    This means that something as simple as [choice (map d ~f) g] creates a leak: it adds a
    handler [f] to [d], which will still run if [d] is filled (effect leak), or stay in
    memory until the subroutine responsible for filling this ivar drops it (memory leak).

    To avoid this memory leak it's sufficient to choose on an pre-existing ivar, whose
    lifetime is controlled separately. For example:
    - use [Pipe.read_choice], not [Pipe.read],
    - use [Clock.Event.fired], not [Clock.after] (then cancel the event).

(** [enabled [choice t1 f1; ... choice tn fn;]] returns a deferred [d] that becomes
    determined when any of the [ti] becomes determined. The value of [d] is a function
    [f] that when called, for each [ti] that is enabled, applies [fi] to [ti], and returns
    a list of the results. It is guaranteed that the list is in the same order as the
    choices supplied to [enabled], but of course it may be shorter than the input list if
    not all [ti] are determined. *)
val enabled : 'b Choice.t list -> (unit -> 'b list) t

(**
   {[
     choose [ choice t1 f1
            ; ...
              ; choice tn fn ] ]}

   returns a deferred [t] that becomes determined with value [fi ai] after some [ti]
   becomes determined with value [ai].  It is guaranteed that [choose] calls at most one
   of the [fi]s, the one that determines its result.  There is no guarantee
   that the [ti] that becomes determined earliest in time will be the one whose value
   determines the [choose].  Nor is it guaranteed that the value in [t] is the first value
   (in place order) from [choices] that is determined at the time [t] is examined.

   For example, in:

   {[
     choose [ choice t1 (fun () -> `X1)
            ; choice t2 (fun () -> `X2) ]
     >>> function
     | `X1 -> e1
     | `X2 -> e2 ]}

   it may be the case that both [t1] and [t2] become determined, yet [e2] actually runs.

   It is guaranteed that if multiple choices are determined with no intervening
   asynchrony, then the earliest choice in the list will become the value of the
   [choose]. *)
