(** [add_finalizer f x] is like [Gc.finalise f x], except that the finalizer is guaranteed
    to run as an Async job (i.e. without interrupting other Async jobs). Unprotected use
    of [Caml.Gc.finalise] or [Core.Gc.add_finalizer] in Async programs is wrong, because
    the finalizers won't hold the async lock, and thus could interleave arbitrarily with
    async jobs. *)
