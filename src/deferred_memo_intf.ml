module type S = sig
  type 'a deferred

  (** Memoization functions like in [Core.Memo], with re-raising of exceptions thrown
      asynchronously.

      Also see [Lazy_deferred], of which [Deferred.Memo.unit] is a special case. *)

  (** [general hashable f] returns a memoized version of [f], where the results are stored
      in a hash table indexed according to [hashable]. If [f a] asynchronously raises,
      then the error is stored in the hash table and is reraised when [a] is demanded.

      Unlike [Core.Memo.general], this [general] does not support [cache_size_bound] due
      to complexities of asynchrony -- even when one has a deferred return by the memoized
      function, there still may be asynchronous jobs working to determine it.

      Unlike [Core.Memo.general], this [general] takes a required [Hashable] module
      argument, to avoid unintentional use of polymorphic comparison. *)
  val general
    :  (module Hashtbl.Key_plain with type t = 'a)

    -> ('a -> 'b deferred) Staged.t

  (** Memoize a recursive asynchronous function. See [Memo.recursive] for the
      introduction. We do not implement Async-aware dependency cycle detection, so if
      recursion is not well-founded then the computation will just deadlock. *)
