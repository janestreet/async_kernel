(** A [Bvar] is a synchronization point that allows one to [broadcast] a value to clients
    [wait]ing on the broadcast. With a [Bvar], one can efficiently notify multiple clients
    of edge-triggered conditions, repeating as each edge trigger occurs.

    [Bvar] is like an {!module:Ivar}/{!module:Deferred}, except that it is always "empty"
    and can be repeatedly "filled" via {!broadcast}. If nobody is waiting on a [Bvar],
    then broadcasting to it is effectively a no-op, and the value that is broadcast is
    lost.

    Another way to view [Bvar] is as a restriction of [Condition] that supports only
    broadcast, not [signal]ing a single waiter. Dropping [signal] simplifies the
    implementation significantly.

    An {!module:Mvar} can mimick a [unit Bvar.t] through appropriate use of its API, but
    is also capable of wider range of synchronization functionality than a [Bvar].

    The ['permissions] parameter is used for read/write permissions. See {!Perms} for more
    information. *)
