(** Implements an async aware throttling rate limiter on top of [Limiter].

    All forms of [enqueue_exn] and [enqueue'] below will raise if the requested job is not
    possible to run within the resource limitations given to the related [create_exn].

    If any enqueued job raises then the exception will be raised to the monitor in scope
    when [enqueue_exn] is called. Deferred jobs passed to [enqueue'] return [Raised] (in a
    deferred manner) instead.

    Jobs are always executed in FIFO order. *)

(** [Throttle], [Sequencer], and [Resource_throttle] re-implement the functionality
    available in the core Async.Throttle module with the hope that these implementations
    can eventually supplant that code. It is helpful to use these modules in systems that
    can afford to do a bit more testing so that we can get feedback on the behavior of the
    new implementation. They are intended to be mostly drop-in replacements. *)

(** Implements a basic throttle meant to bound the number of jobs that can concurrently
    run. Additionally the [~burst_size] and [~sustained_rate_per_sec] arguments can be
    used to control how many jobs can be spawned in a burst, and how quickly jobs can be
    spawned over time. If these options are not given to [create_exn] they are unbounded.

    [concurrent_jobs_target] is the desired maximum number of concurrent jobs. If the
    value is never changed, then this is in fact a hard upper bound. The value is mutable,
    however, and so may be violated temporarily if the value is reduced. *)
